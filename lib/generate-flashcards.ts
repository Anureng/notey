      title: "Rocket Propulsion Basics",
      content:
        "Rocket propulsion works on Newton's Third Law: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. As high-pressure gases are expelled from the combustion chamber through the nozzle, they create thrust in the opposite direction. The rocket equation (Tsiolkovsky equation) relates the change in velocity to the exhaust velocity and mass ratio: ΔV = Vₑ × ln(m₀/m₁).",

      title: "Types of Rocket Engines",
      content:
        "Chemical rockets use propellants that react to produce hot gases. Solid rockets use a solid fuel and oxidizer mixture, while liquid rockets store fuel and oxidizer separately. Ion thrusters use electricity to accelerate ions, providing low thrust but high efficiency. Nuclear thermal rockets heat propellant using a nuclear reactor, offering higher specific impulse than chemical rockets.",

      title: "Specific Impulse (Isp)",
      content:
        "Specific impulse (Isp) measures rocket engine efficiency, defined as thrust produced per unit of propellant mass flow rate. Higher Isp indicates more efficient propellant use. Measured in seconds, it represents how long 1 kg of propellant can produce 1 newton of thrust. Chemical rockets typically achieve 250-450s, while ion thrusters can reach 3000s or higher.",

      title: "Multi-stage Rockets",
      content:
        "Multi-stage rockets discard spent stages during flight to reduce mass. This improves efficiency by not carrying empty propellant tanks and engines that are no longer needed. The staging process significantly increases payload capacity to orbit compared to single-stage vehicles. Most orbital launch vehicles use 2-3 stages to optimize performance.",

      title: "Rocket Nozzle Design",
      content:
        "Rocket nozzles convert the high-pressure, high-temperature gases in the combustion chamber into high-velocity exhaust. The converging-diverging (de Laval) nozzle accelerates subsonic flow to supersonic speeds. Nozzle expansion ratio is optimized for specific atmospheric conditions. Underexpanded nozzles lose efficiency at low altitudes, while overexpanded nozzles can cause flow separation.",

      title: "Orbital Mechanics Basics",
      content:
        "Orbital mechanics governs spacecraft motion using Kepler's laws and Newton's laws of motion and gravitation. Key concepts include orbital elements (inclination, eccentricity, etc.), Hohmann transfer orbits for efficient path between orbits, and gravitational assists that use a planet's gravity to change spacecraft velocity and direction without using propellant.",
    },
    {
      title: "Rocket Stability and Control",
      content:
        "Rocket stability requires the center of pressure to be behind the center of mass. Control systems include gimbaled engines (thrust vectoring), vernier thrusters, grid fins, and reaction control systems (RCS). Modern rockets use computerized guidance systems with inertial measurement units (IMUs), GPS, and feedback control algorithms to maintain precise trajectory.",

      title: "Propellant Combinations",
      content:
        "Common propellant combinations include: LOX/RP-1 (liquid oxygen and refined kerosene) used in Falcon 9 and Atlas rockets; LOX/LH2 (liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen) used in Space Shuttle and Delta IV; N2O4/UDMH (nitrogen tetroxide and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine) used in many satellite thrusters; and solid propellants like APCP (ammonium perchlorate composite propellant) used in SRBs.",
